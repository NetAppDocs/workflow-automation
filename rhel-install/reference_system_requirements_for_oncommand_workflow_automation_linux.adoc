*Note:* If you are installing WFA on a virtual machine (VM), you should reserve the required memory and CPU so that the VM has sufficient resources. The installer does not verify the CPU speed.

== Software requirements for installing WFA

The following table lists all the operating system versions compatible with the WFA server.

|===
a|
Operating System

*Note:* WFA should be installed on dedicated physical machines or VMs. You must not install any other application on the server that runs WFA.

* One of the following supported browsers:
 ** Mozilla Firefox
 ** Microsoft Internet Explorer
 ** Google Chrome
* Perl v5.x
+
You can obtain information about the Perl modules that should be installed by using the `./WFA-version_number.bin -l` command.

For more details, see the https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix/[Interoperability Matrix Tool].

NOTE: Antivirus applications might prevent WFA services from starting.

To avoid this issue, configure antivirus scanning exclusions for the following WFA directories:

* The directory where you have installed WFA
* The directory where you have installed Perl
* The directory where you have installed OpenJDK
* The MySQL Data Directory
