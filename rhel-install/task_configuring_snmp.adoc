You can configure OnCommand Workflow Automation (WFA) to send Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) traps about the status of workflow operations.

WFA now supports SNMP v1 and SNMP v3 protocols. SNMP v3 provides additional security features.

The WFA .mib file provides information about the traps that are sent by the WFA server. The .mib file is located in the <WFA_install_location>\wfa\bin\wfa.mib directory on the WFA server.

NOTE: The WFA server sends all the trap notifications with a generic object identifier (1.3.6.1.4.1.789.1.1.12.0).

You cannot use SNMP community strings such as community_string@SNMP_host for SNMP configuration.
