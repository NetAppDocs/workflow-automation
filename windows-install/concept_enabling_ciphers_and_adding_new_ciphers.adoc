OnCommand Workflow Automation 5.1 supports a number of ciphers out of the box. Also, you can add additional ciphers as required.

The following ciphers can be enabled out of the box:

----
enabled-cipher-suites=
"TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,
TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,
TLS_ECDH_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_ECDH_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384,
TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256,TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384"
----

Additional ciphers can be added to this configuration in the `standalone-full.xml` file. This file is located at: `<installdir>/jboss/standalone/configuration/standalone-full.xml`.

The file can be modified to support additional ciphers as follows:

----
<https-listener name="https" socket-binding="https" max-post-size="1073741824" security-realm="SSLRealm"
enabled-cipher-suites="**< --- add additional ciphers here ---\>**
enabled-protocols="TLSv1.1,TLSv1.2"/>
